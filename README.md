***EPIGENOMICS:***
- Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the epigenome.<br>
- Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair.<br>
- Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis.<br>
