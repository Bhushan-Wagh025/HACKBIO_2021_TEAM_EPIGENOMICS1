***EPIGENOMICS:***
- Epigenetics is the study of the epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of the cell. This modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation. They are involved in numerous cellular processes and have been implicated in several diseases such as cancer and viral infections.

#### ATAC-SEQ analysis:
- ATAC-Seq stands for Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing.
- The ATAC-Seq method relies on next-generation sequencing (NGS) library construction using the hyperactive transposase Tn5.

***Our Aim over ATAC-SEQ analysis is :-***
- Is to investigate the chromatin accessibility and the genome is treated with a transposase (enzyme) called Tn5. 
- It marks open chromatin regions by cutting and inserting adapters for sequencing.
